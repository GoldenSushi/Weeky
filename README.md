####My sad busy week

~~The best android app in the world.~~  
Well, actually this is just a practice from someone who is starting to lean how to program, and it is almost useless.

This app is basically an agenda, a datebook for students, that was made to register classes and their respective classrooms at a given hour of the day.
It basically lets the user write a value for the class and classroom at any day of the week, from 7:00 to 18:00 (because, who wants to study after or before that, right?).

    Well, it is pretty useless, but everything has to start somewhere, huh?
    The user can add new entries by long clicking any field.
